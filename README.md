# Rachel

Personal AI assistant on Telegram, powered by Claude Code or Codex. Runs 24/7 on your server — builds landing pages, tracks leads, manages contacts, creates documents, schedules tasks, does research, and more. All from a simple Telegram message.

Rachel supports both the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) and the [OpenAI Codex SDK](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk/). Choose the provider with `AI_PROVIDER=claudecode` or `AI_PROVIDER=codex` in `.env`. The default is `codex`.

You need exactly one provider CLI installed on the server:
- `claudecode` needs Claude Code installed and logged in
- `codex` needs Codex installed and logged in

## What can she do?

- Build and host landing pages, track form submissions
- Send you lead data as Excel, CSV, or any format
- Manage contacts, follow-ups, and reminders
- Create documents, proposals, presentations on demand
- Research anything — suppliers, competitors, market data
- Schedule tasks, set reminders, handle your admin work
- Read any file you send: PDFs, images, audio, video
- Run code, manage servers, deploy projects
- Remember everything — persistent memory across all conversations

She's not a chatbot. She's a full AI agent with tools, running on your own server.

## Setup

`bun run setup` writes `.env` and is the setup flow.

All commands below assume a fresh Ubuntu server. Run everything in order.

### 1. Create the `rachel` user (as root)

SSH in as root, then create a dedicated user. Rachel runs as a regular Linux user — no sudo needed.

```bash
adduser rachel --ingroup users --disabled-password
```

Press Enter through the Full Name / Room / Phone prompts. Then switch to the new user:

```bash
su - rachel
```

**All remaining steps run as `rachel`.**

### 2. Install system dependencies and Bun

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y unzip gh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Log in to GitHub

```bash
gh auth login
```

### 4. Install one provider CLI

Pick one.

For `AI_PROVIDER=claudecode`:

On Linux/server environments:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

On macOS with Homebrew-managed Node:

```bash
brew install node
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

For `AI_PROVIDER=codex`:

On Linux/server environments:

Rachel can use the bundled Codex CLI after `bun install`, so there is nothing extra to install in this step.

On macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask codex
```

Both setups work the same once the chosen CLI is installed and logged in, so a Linux VPS and a Mac mini server follow the same Rachel flow after this step.

### Provider CLI path notes

Rachel needs to be able to find the selected provider CLI from both your shell and the `systemd --user` service.

- Rachel automatically checks common install locations, including `~/.local/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, and `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`
- This covers typical Homebrew/Linuxbrew installs of both Codex and Claude Code
- `systemd --user` may not inherit the same `PATH` as your interactive shell, so a CLI that works in your terminal can still fail when Rachel runs as a service

### 5. Clone and install

```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/rachel8 ~/rachel8
cd ~/rachel8
bun install
```

### 6. Log in to your chosen provider CLI

For `AI_PROVIDER=claudecode`:

```bash
claude login
claude -p 'say hello'
```

For `AI_PROVIDER=codex`:

```bash
bun x codex login
codex login status
```

Rachel expects the selected CLI to already be logged in on the server. There are no provider-specific auth settings in `.env`.

### 7. Run the setup wizard

```bash
bun run setup
```

The wizard will ask for:
- **Telegram bot token** — create one via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (`/newbot`)
- **Your Telegram user ID** — send `/start` to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- **AI provider** — `claudecode` or `codex`
- **Shared folder path** — where Rachel stores memory, files, and data
- **systemd service** — optionally installs Rachel as a background service

### 8. Start Rachel

If you installed the systemd service (recommended):

```bash
systemctl --user start rachel8
systemctl --user status rachel8
```

Or run manually:

```bash
cd ~/rachel8
bun run start
```

That's it. Send a message to your bot on Telegram.

## Before you start: create your Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram, search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name (e.g., "Rachel")
4. Choose a username (e.g., "my_rachel_bot")
5. Copy the token — you'll paste it into the setup wizard

## Development

```bash
bun run dev          # Start with hot reload (bun --watch)
bun run start        # Start normally
bun run setup        # Re-run setup wizard
bun test             # Run tests
```

## Remote Re-Login

If the selected CLI session expires, Rachel will tell you on Telegram and ask you to run `/login`.

- `/login` starts the login flow for the configured provider
- `/login_status` shows whether `claudecode` or `codex` is currently logged in
- `/login_code <code>` sends a one-time code back to the CLI if the provider asks for it
- `/login_cancel` aborts an in-progress login flow

## How it works

Rachel runs behind a provider adapter. Depending on `AI_PROVIDER`, it uses Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Codex SDK with full tool access:

- **Bash** — run any command on the server
- **File system** — read, write, edit any file
- **Web** — search the web, fetch URLs, scrape data
- **Memory** — persistent storage that survives restarts and context resets
- **Tasks** — SQLite-backed scheduler for reminders, cron jobs, and autonomous agent tasks
- **Skills** — extensible via skill files (PDF generation, Excel, web design, etc.)
